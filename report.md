$UFC Dataset findings

In this project, I have decided to analyse some fights to find any specific correlations or any cool findings.

![Gloves-WinRate-Championship](https://github.com/eyadhajj/UFC_Data_AnalysisProject/assets/115934916/0bdcb47a-6c47-446d-bcc4-1ee0a42a4b33)

This is the ratio of wins based off the glove colours in fight.

![Title_vs_Nontitle_ratio](https://github.com/eyadhajj/UFC_Data_AnalysisProject/assets/115934916/54fbbd1b-b418-4e4f-8f88-e2fe77ce01c9)

Finding of the amount of fights that have happened that are a championship bout.
