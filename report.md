# UFC Dataset findings

In this project, I have decided to analyse some fights to find any specific correlations or any cool findings.

This is the ratio of wins based off the glove colours in fight.

Finding of the amount of fights that have happened that are a championship bout.

Stances in UFC events.
Keep in mind, many fighters switch their stances in their career. This could be for strategic advantage against certain opponents or perhaps have adopted a new style of fighting. A common example is Alexander "The Great" Volkonovski. Whilst he primarily uses an orthodox stance, some of his fights have used a southpaw stance and a switch stance approach. Pie chart below.
